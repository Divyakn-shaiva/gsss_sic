Remote repo--i have created a text file 
i need to update it in local Repo
this process is called pull.
$git add .
$git add ./notes1(folder_name)
$ git commit -m "I added a new file"
$git pull

now delete file in remopte repo but still it is present in local repo
again if u give git pull in cmd the deleted file in remote repo is removed in local repo  

PUSH
make changes in local REPO
$ git commit -m "I updated a file"  // gives you the modified red message
$git add .
$git add ./notes1(folder_name)
$ git commit -m "I updated a new file"
$git push

interpreter converts data into integer to float but not float to integer
day3
in python for loop i+=2 is waste it doesn't increment ,,,,if we need to increment then use step size in range like for i in range(1,10,2)
*var_args- takes any number of arguments like my_range(1,100,2,3....)
yield:it gives values to some function
map:access all the elements one by one 
application :we use application and application use softwareto give output
pymysql:it is a bridge

day4:
if size  of an array is fixed then wastage or shortage of memory occurs
memory is allocated during run time only,but how much memory is allocated is decided  at runtime depending upon  user variable type... static and dynamically
java:we only allocate but no deallocation concept 
c++:we can allocate and deaalocate
python: we neither allocate nor deallocate
setter and getter methods: set is also called as mutators(modifies the values) and get is also called as accessors(reads the values).
if we achive encapsulation then abstraction is also done 
class:it is a solution for an entity ,objects are created while accessing a class .
class NRIAccount (Account):         # python inheritance:add new features to the existing solution but it should not change the existing solutions..
  def __init__(self):
     passportNumber = ""

to use extends we need 2 lists
reverse() is by default False 
sort() is mutators
list2=sorted(list1):this remains the list 1 values same but list2 is sorted   # deep copy:one list remains same but another list is sorted or changed
																		       #shallow copy:both the lists are change
day5:
print(capitals[::3]) =====>  start:stop:jump
enumerate: it will give index with element
in odd placed even digits and in even place odd digits and sum :789648756
30 square= 900: 31 square add 30+31 to 900
29 square subtract 30+29  to 900

enumerate() is a built-in Python function that lets you loop with an index (position number).
ex:0 6
1 5
2 4
3 3
4 2
5 1
ip address: to connect to particular computer uniquely
port number : to connect to particular application
mysql connection: 
mysql -u root -p
enter password: your password
show databases; 6 rows in set : why set in mysql  ==>bcoz set doesnt store duplicate values over list but list stores dupplicate values
create database divya_db;
use divya_db;
create table
meta data==>data about the data
delete * from employees; # delete rows in table and when we insert any data it starts from 11 as it is auto inc 
truncate table employees; # delete  rows in table and when we insert any data it starts from again 1 as it is auto
drop table employees; # delete entire table
