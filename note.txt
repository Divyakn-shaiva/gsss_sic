Remote repo--i have created a text file 
i need to update it in local Repo
this process is called pull.
$git add .
$git add ./notes1(folder_name)
$ git commit -m "I added a new file"
$git pull

now delete file in remopte repo but still it is present in local repo
again if u give git pull in cmd the deleted file in remote repo is removed in local repo  

PUSH
make changes in local REPO
$ git commit -m "I updated a file"  // gives you the modified red message
$git add .
$git add ./notes1(folder_name)
$ git commit -m "I updated a new file"
$git push

interpreter converts data into integer to float but not float to integer

in python for loop i+=2 is waste it doesn't increment ,,,,if we need to increment then use step size in range like for i in range(1,10,2)
*var_args- takes any number of arguments like my_range(1,100,2,3....)
yield:it gives values to some function
map:access all the elements one by one 
application :we use application and application use softwareto give output
pymysql:it is a bridge
